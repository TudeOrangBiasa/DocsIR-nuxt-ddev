The Linux filesystem hierarchy is a tree-like structure that starts at the root directory, which is represented by a forward slash (/). All other directories and files are located under the root directory. The filesystem hierarchy is organized in a way that makes it easy to find and manage files. For example, all of the system's configuration files are located in the /etc directory, and all of the user's personal files are located in the /home directory.
