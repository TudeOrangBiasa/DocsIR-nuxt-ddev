The Linux kernel is the core of the Linux operating system. It is the first program that is loaded when the computer starts up, and it is responsible for managing the computer's resources, such as the CPU, memory, and storage. The kernel provides a layer of abstraction between the hardware and the software, which makes it easier for software developers to write programs that can run on a variety of different hardware platforms.
