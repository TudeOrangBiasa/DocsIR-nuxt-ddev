The TCP/IP stack is a suite of communication protocols that are used to connect computers to the Internet. The TCP/IP stack is divided into four layers: the application layer, the transport layer, the Internet layer, and the link layer. Each layer performs a specific function, and the layers work together to provide a reliable and efficient way to communicate over the Internet.
