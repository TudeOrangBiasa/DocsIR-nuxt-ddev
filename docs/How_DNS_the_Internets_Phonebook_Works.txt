DNS is a system that translates domain names into IP addresses. Domain names are the human-readable names that we use to access websites, such as google.com and facebook.com. IP addresses are the numerical addresses that computers use to identify each other on the Internet. DNS is an essential part of the Internet, and it is what allows us to access websites by their domain names.
