The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. The model is divided into seven layers, each of which performs a specific function. The OSI model is a useful tool for understanding how networks work and for troubleshooting network problems.
